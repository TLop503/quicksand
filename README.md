# quicksand

## Project Overview
A Browserling alternative using containers as a way to investigate websites. This will be a web-based user interface that will utilize an iframe with  
the sandbox attribute to isolate the content and enhance provided security. The use of containers will allow for easy cleanup via Ansible without directly  
restarting the host. There will be an opt-in IP anonymization trigger that routes the IP through TOR and is compatible with Chrome and Firefox.
